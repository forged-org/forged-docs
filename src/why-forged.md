# Why Forged?

Forged was developed by embedded system engineers to solve issues faced during the development and
manufacturing of hardware.

Some specific goals that forged is trying to solve:
* Easily and reliably deploy firmware to production, where the production house may be an external
  department or even out-of-house contract manufacturer continents away.
* Guarantee data discoverability, retention, and preservation
* Allow easy device-specific configuration management
* Enable non-technical individuals to easily use complex manufacturing processes without complex
  training
* Enable traceability within the manufacturing and provisioning process to well-defined requirements
  and data layouts.
* Enable manufacturers to easily validate device behaviors before shipping product to customers
